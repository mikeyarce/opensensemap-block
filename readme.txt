== Description ==

**Display live environmental sensor data from openSenseMap.org directly in your WordPress site**

openSenseMap is a citizen science platform for publishing and exploring sensor data as open data. Anyone can build their own sensor box (called a senseBox), register it on openSenseMap, and contribute to a global network of environmental measurements. Learn more at [openSenseMap.org](https://opensensemap.org/) and [About openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org/about).

Want to build your own sensor? Check out the [sensor.community guides](https://sensor.community/en/sensors/airrohr/).
